Today, I am grateful for:

The warm cup of coffee I had this morning that helped me start my day off right.
The beautiful sunrise I saw on my way to work that reminded me of the beauty in nature.
The supportive friends and family in my life who are always there for me when I need them.
The fact that I have a job that allows me to support myself and pursue my passions.
The opportunity to take a walk outside during my lunch break and soak up some sunshine and fresh air.
Writing down these things I am grateful for helps me appreciate the positive aspects of my life and shifts my focus away from negativity. It reminds me that even on the toughest days, there are still things to be grateful for and that there is always something to look forward to tomorrow.

Location: Paris, France

Today was my first day in Paris and it was absolutely magical. I woke up early and headed straight to the Eiffel Tower to catch the sunrise. The view from the top was breathtaking, with the sun just peeking over the horizon and casting a warm glow over the city.

After breakfast at a local cafe, I spent the rest of the day exploring the city on foot. I walked along the Seine River, admiring the beautiful architecture of the buildings and bridges. I stopped at Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was just as stunning as I had imagined.

In the afternoon, I visited the Louvre Museum and was completely blown away by the art collection. I spent hours wandering through the galleries, taking in the beauty and history of the paintings and sculptures.

As the day came to a close, I sat in a small park and watched as the sun set over the city. I felt so grateful to be here, experiencing all of the amazing sights and sounds that Paris has to offer.

This trip has already been such an incredible adventure, and I can’t wait to see what the rest of it has in store for me.

Here are a few of my favorite photos from the day. I think I’ll get these framed when I get home.

Today’s Journal Prompt:
What are my core values and how do they impact my decisions?

Today I’ve been considering my core values and how they impact the decisions I make in my life. I realize that my values are an essential part of who I am, and they play a significant role in shaping my thoughts, actions, and choices.

One of my core values is honesty. I believe that it’s essential to be truthful with myself and others, even when it’s difficult. When I’m faced with a decision, I always try to consider whether it aligns with my values of honesty and integrity. If I feel that a decision would compromise these values, I know that it’s not the right choice for me.

Another value that’s important to me is kindness. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and compassion, regardless of their background or circumstances. When I’m making a decision, I try to consider how it will impact others and whether it aligns with my values of kindness and empathy.

Finally, I value personal growth and self-improvement. I believe that life is a journey of learning and self-discovery, and I always strive to grow and evolve as a person. When I’m making a decision, I try to consider whether it will help me grow and develop as a person, both personally and professionally.

Reflecting on my core values has helped me gain clarity on what’s important to me and how I can make decisions that align with my values. I know that when I make choices that align with my values, I feel more fulfilled, purposeful, and true to myself.

Today was a busy day at work. I had a lot of meetings and deadlines to meet, which kept me on my toes all day. I felt a little bit stressed at times, but overall, I was able to stay focused and get everything done that needed to be done.

During my lunch break, I went for a walk around the park near my office. It was a beautiful day outside, and I felt grateful for the opportunity to get some fresh air and sunshine. As I walked, I listened to a podcast about mindfulness and tried to focus on being present in the moment.

After work, I met up with a friend for dinner. We caught up on each other’s lives and talked about our plans for the future. It was nice to have some social time after a busy day at work.

Before bed, I took some time to reflect on the day. I thought about the things that went well and the areas where I could improve. I also wrote down some goals for tomorrow, including getting up a little bit earlier and taking a few moments to meditate before starting my day.

Overall, today was a good day. I feel grateful for the opportunities and experiences that came my way, and I’m looking forward to what tomorrow will bring.

Today, I decided to experiment with some mixed media art in my art journal. I started by collaging some old book pages onto the page, creating a textured background. Then, I used watercolors to paint over the top, blending different colors and creating a dreamy, abstract effect.

Next, I used some blank ink to add some hand-lettering to the page in big, block letters. The phrase that came to mind was “If not now, when?” This is a quote I’ve been thinking about for a long time, especially when it comes to sharing more of my artwork.


Today started off on a stressful note. I got stuck in heavy traffic on my way to work, and ended up arriving late. As soon as I walked into the office, my manager confronted me about my tardiness, which only added to my anxiety.

I felt my heart rate skyrocket and my palms start to sweat. All I wanted to do was run to the bathroom and cry. I hate being late, and I felt like I was already starting the day off on the wrong foot. As the day went on, my anxiety gradually subsided, and I was able to focus on my work and be productive.

Next time, I hope to remember to pause and take a few deep breaths while I remind myself that the traffic was out of my control. I couldn’t have predicted the delay, and I did the best I could under the circumstances. I also need to remember that being late once doesn’t make me a bad employee.

In the future, I’ll try to leave earlier to avoid getting stuck in traffic, but I also know that sometimes unexpected delays happen, and it’s important to be kind and patient with myself when they do.

Other notes:

Weather: Thunderstorms
Sleep: Last night, I was quite restless and had a hard time falling asleep.
Food + beverage intake: Had an extra cup of coffee late in the day yesterday. Perhaps that’s why I didn’t sleep well last night.

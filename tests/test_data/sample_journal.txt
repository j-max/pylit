I am excited about the Sentence class I coded today.  It seems like it could be a useful tool to help writers explore granular aspects of their writing. It is fun making choices about what parts of a sentence are important, and what attributes a Sentence class should have.

I am a bit worried that I am overengineering this project.  Even if it is, it is good practice in organization.  It is interesting to think about natural language components as Python objects.

I am excited about having a set of classes that inherit the properties of the Document class.  I will have a journal class which has time-based sentiment analysis.  I will have an essay class which will have a property of a document length goal, as well as a method to identify repeated phrases and ideas.  I will have a poem class which describes number of lines, and perhaps common phonemes.

I wonder if I am actually going to finish this project, or at least get an MVP completed.  I have a lot of ideas, and some coding done, but I question the actual utility of the project.  Will it be useful to anyone other than me?  Will it be useful to me?

I've taken a bit of time away from this project.  I went to Memphis for a long weekend.  The Civil Rights Museum, Sun Studio, and Stax were incredible.  The soul food at 4 Way and Alcenia's were some of the best meals I've had.

I hope to regain some momentum on this project in the coming weeks.  I'm excited about where the Journal class could be heading.

I am adding sentiment analysis to the Sentence class.  While I am doing that, I am becoming more familiar with NLTK's functions and classes.  I am worried I might be replicating their work, which would be bad.  But, I am pushing ahead despite my reservations.  I think I will learn something no matter what by working on this project.  Hopefully, it will provide an accurate snapshot of my coding skills.

I'm having trouble keeping momentum on this project, though I think about it fairly often.  I would like to approach it incrementally.  Today, I revisted the Dash App, and will aim to plot a sentiment graph in the middle of the first page of the dashboard.

Feeling pretty good about adding more journaling functionality to the code base.  I need to add code that parses the dates. I also nee to put in code that extracts sentences with extreme sentiment scores.  These can then be displayed on the dashboard.

Is it a good idea to look at sentiment by day?  It could be interesting to look at cumulative sentament by day, adding the sentiment of the sentences grouped by time stamp.

Had a wonderful morning.  The birds were singing.  The sun was shining.  I was excited to go to learn a new dance at Traffic Jam.

I had a very bad day today.  Nothing seemed to go right.
